**CSS Color Palette Picker**

I've come to appreciate the color principals in the Tailwind css library. Having an extensive palette of colors that span the brightness values of each hue you are using helps create a more polished design by allowing effective hierarchy design. This site allows you to create color palettes by hue, set the maximum and minimum lightness values, and copy the CSS variables for each color.
