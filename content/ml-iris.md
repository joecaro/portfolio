**CSS Design Examples**

I've studied Machine Learning in school, primarily using tools like the Orange Data Mining application to leverage machine learning on data samples. This was my first project using an ML library to make my own models to solve a problem.

Beyond this I've also worked on creating my own neural networks from scratch.
