**Client CRM**

This is an internal tool I created using Nextjs and MongoDB to help track clients progress during a reporting period. The main purpose was to speed up our tracking speed and reduce effort. Previously we used excel to track this information, so having a database and tailored UI has sped up the process.

The key features of this CRUD application are:

- Create new records, assigning them to one of a select number of groups.
- Within each group, easily track the progress of each record
- Store simple information on each record like date completed, notes, and point of contact
- Have quick at a glance totals for each page as well as an spreadsheet export
