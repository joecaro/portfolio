## 3D Flappy Bird Clone

This project marks my first game built in the **Unity Engine** and my introduction to **C#**, a strongly typed, object-oriented language. Inspired by the simplicity of the original **Flappy Bird**, I reimagined it in 3D, using Unity to handle the physics and gameplay mechanics while creating all the assets and materials in **Blender**.

## Why I Built It

As someone interested in both game development and 3D modeling, I wanted to create a project that would help me learn Unity, C#, and 3D asset creation all at once. The original Flappy Bird was the perfect inspiration for its simplicity and engaging mechanics, which allowed me to focus on the essentials of game development while also exploring 3D design.

## Features

- **3D Gameplay**: Unlike the original 2D version, this clone brings the game into a 3D environment, giving a fresh perspective to the classic gameplay.
- **Unity Physics**: I used Unity's built-in physics engine to handle the core mechanics, such as the playerâ€™s jump and the obstacle movement, ensuring the game feels smooth and responsive.
- **Custom 3D Assets**: All of the assets, from the bird to the pipes, were modeled in **Blender**, making this project a complete learning experience in both game design and 3D modeling.

## Tech Stack

- **Unity**: The game is built in Unity, utilizing its physics engine and game development tools to bring the 3D Flappy Bird world to life.
- **C#**: As my first project in C#, this game was a great introduction to object-oriented programming and Unity's scripting API.
- **Blender**: I created all the 3D models and textures in Blender, giving me the opportunity to combine my passion for 3D modeling with game development.

## What I Learned

Working on this project was a fantastic introduction to game development and 3D design. I learned how to apply physics-based gameplay in Unity, gained a strong understanding of **C#** for scripting game mechanics, and expanded my skills in **Blender** for asset creation. This project allowed me to combine technical and creative skills, making it a rewarding experience.
