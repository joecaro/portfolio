## Building a Custom Web Component UI Library: The Power of Native Web Technologies

In my quest to build a versatile, cross-platform UI component library, I stumbled into the world of **Web Components**. While I've built many tools using frameworks like React and Vue, this time I wanted something more flexible, something that could easily plug into any environment—from WordPress to a custom React application—without much overhead. Enter **Web Components**.

<InteractiveDemo title="Web Components vs React Comparison">

Here's a quick comparison of how Web Components relate to React concepts:

| Web Component Callback | React Equivalent | Description |
|------------------------|------------------|-------------|
| `connectedCallback` | `componentDidMount` | Runs when the element is added to the DOM—great for initial setup. |
| `disconnectedCallback` | `componentWillUnmount` | Runs when the element is removed—useful for cleanup. |
| `attributeChangedCallback` | `componentDidUpdate` | Fires when observed attributes change—ideal for responding to prop changes. |

</InteractiveDemo>

## What Are Web Components?

At their core, **Web Components** are a set of APIs that let you create reusable, encapsulated HTML elements. Unlike traditional front-end frameworks, Web Components run natively in the browser, which means they don't require extra libraries or frameworks.

There are three key technologies behind Web Components:

- **Custom Elements**: Define your own HTML tags with custom functionality.
- **Shadow DOM**: Encapsulates the element's styles and behavior, preventing external CSS or JS from affecting it.
- **HTML Templates**: Reusable markup structures that can be cloned and inserted into the DOM.

<CodePlayground 
  language="javascript" 
  initialCode="// Simple Web Component example
class MyButton extends HTMLElement {
  connectedCallback() {
    this.innerHTML = `
      <style>
        button { 
          background: #3b82f6; 
          color: white; 
          border: none; 
          padding: 8px 16px; 
          border-radius: 4px; 
          cursor: pointer;
        }
        button:hover { background: #2563eb; }
      </style>
      <button>Click me!</button>
    `;
    this.querySelector('button').addEventListener('click', () => {
      console.log('Button clicked!');
    });
  }
}

// Register the custom element
customElements.define('my-button', MyButton);

// RENDER: my-button
console.log('Web Component defined and ready to render!');"
/>

## Building the Component Library

This project gave me hands-on experience with the core principles of component design and the challenges of building truly reusable, framework-agnostic components.

### Key Features

- **Framework Agnostic**: Works with React, Vue, Angular, or vanilla HTML
- **Encapsulated Styling**: Shadow DOM prevents style conflicts
- **Custom Events**: Native event system for component communication
- **Lightweight**: No framework dependencies

<InteractiveDemo title="Technical Implementation Details">

The library includes several key components:

1. **Base Component Class**: Common functionality for all components
2. **Styling System**: CSS-in-JS with theming support
3. **Event Management**: Custom event dispatching and handling
4. **Attribute Observation**: Reactive updates when attributes change

The most interesting aspect was implementing a styling system that works across different environments while maintaining encapsulation.

## What I Learned

Building this **Web Component UI library** was an eye-opening experience. It reinforced my belief in the power of native browser technologies and the flexibility they offer. While frameworks like React and Vue are fantastic for most use cases, Web Components shine when you need something lightweight, encapsulated, and reusable across many different platforms.
