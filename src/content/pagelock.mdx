# Page Lock - React Ownership Management Library

Page Lock is a React library I built to solve a common problem in collaborative web applications: **preventing multiple users from editing the same content simultaneously**. It provides elegant, real-time page ownership management with built-in UI components and hooks.

## The Problem

In collaborative applications, when multiple users try to edit the same record or page simultaneously, you get:
- **Data conflicts** - Last save wins, losing other users' work
- **User confusion** - People don't know someone else is editing
- **Wasted effort** - Duplicate work that gets overwritten

Traditional solutions are either too complex or don't provide good UX.

## The Solution

Page Lock provides a simple, elegant solution with:

🔐 **Real-time ownership tracking** - Know who's editing what, when  
🔄 **Automatic ownership transfer** - Seamless handoffs between users  
🎨 **Beautiful UI components** - Ready-to-use badges and modals  
📱 **Mobile-friendly design** - Works great on all devices  
🎯 **TypeScript support** - Full type safety out of the box  
🚀 **Framework agnostic** - Works with Next.js, Create React App, etc.

## Live Demo

## Key Features

### 🔒 Flexible Locking Strategies

```javascript
// Lock entire pages
const { lockPage, unlockPage } = usePageOwnership({ 
  pageId: 'user-profile-123' 
});

// Lock specific components
<OwnershipModal pageId="document-editor-456" />

// Just show ownership status
<OwnerBadge pageId="settings-panel-789" />
```

### 🌐 Multiple Storage Adapters

```javascript
// Use localStorage for simple cases
const adapter = createLocalStorageAdapter({
  prefix: 'my-app'
});

// Use your API for production
const adapter = createApiStorageAdapter({
  getAllOwners: () => fetch('/api/owners').then(r => r.json()),
  lockPage: (pageId, userId, userName) => 
    fetch('/api/lock', { method: 'POST', body: JSON.stringify({pageId, userId, userName}) }),
  unlockPage: (pageId, userId) => 
    fetch('/api/unlock', { method: 'POST', body: JSON.stringify({pageId, userId}) }),
  takePageOwnership: (pageId, userId, userName) => 
    fetch('/api/take-ownership', { method: 'POST', body: JSON.stringify({pageId, userId, userName}) })
});
```

### ⚡ Real-time Updates

The library polls for ownership changes at configurable intervals (default 3 seconds), ensuring all users see locks and releases immediately. No websockets required!

## Technical Architecture

### Core Components

| Component | Purpose | Use Case |
|-----------|---------|----------|
| `OwnershipProvider` | Context provider for ownership state | Wrap your app or specific sections |
| `usePageOwnership` | Hook for programmatic control | Custom implementations |
| `OwnerBadge` | Simple ownership indicator | Show who owns what |
| `OwnershipModal` | Full ownership management UI | Complete lock/unlock flow |

### Type Safety

```typescript
interface PageOwner {
  user_id: string;
  user_name: string;
  page_id: string;
  timestamp: number;
}

interface OwnershipConfig {
  userAdapter: UserAdapter;
  ownershipAdapter: OwnershipAdapter;
  options?: {
    pollingInterval?: number;
  };
}
```

## Real-World Use Cases

### 1. **CRM Record Editing**
Prevent sales reps from simultaneously editing the same customer record, avoiding data loss and confusion.

### 2. **Document Collaboration**
Lock document sections while users are editing, similar to Google Docs but for React applications.

### 3. **Configuration Management**
Ensure only one admin can modify system settings at a time, preventing conflicting changes.

### 4. **Form Workflows**
Lock multi-step forms to prevent multiple submissions or conflicting edits during long workflows.

## Installation & Quick Start

```bash
npm install @joecarot/page-lock
# or
yarn add @joecarot/page-lock
```

### Basic Implementation

```jsx
import {
  OwnershipProvider,
  createLocalStorageAdapter,
  OwnerBadge
} from '@joecarot/page-lock';

// Setup adapters
const userAdapter = {
  getCurrentUser: () => Promise.resolve({
    id: 'user-123',
    email: 'user@example.com',
    name: 'John Doe'
  })
};

const ownershipAdapter = createLocalStorageAdapter({
  prefix: 'my-app'
});

const config = {
  userAdapter,
  ownershipAdapter,
  options: {
    pollingInterval: 3000
  }
};

// Use in your app
function App() {
  return (
    <OwnershipProvider config={config}>
      <div>
        <h1>User Profile</h1>
        <OwnerBadge pageId="user-profile-123" />
        {/* Your form content */}
      </div>
    </OwnershipProvider>
  );
}
```

## Development Process

### Built with Modern Tools

- **TypeScript** for type safety and better DX
- **Jest** for comprehensive testing
- **GitHub Actions** for CI/CD
- **tsup** for efficient bundling
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling

### Testing Strategy

```bash
# Run tests
npm test

# Coverage report
npm run coverage

# Run example
cd example && npm start
```

The library includes extensive unit tests covering:
- Ownership state management
- Real-time polling behavior
- Error handling scenarios
- Component rendering states

## Performance Considerations

### Optimized Polling

- **Smart intervals**: Only polls when components are mounted
- **Efficient updates**: Uses React's built-in state management
- **Memory cleanup**: Automatic cleanup on unmount

### Bundle Size

The library is designed to be lightweight:
- Tree-shakeable exports
- Minimal dependencies
- Efficient TypeScript compilation

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features

🔄 **WebSocket Support** - Real-time updates without polling  
🎭 **Role-based Permissions** - Different lock types for different user roles  
🔌 **More Adapters** - Redis, PostgreSQL, MongoDB adapters  
📊 **Analytics** - Usage tracking and ownership metrics  
🎨 **Theme Customization** - More styling options

## Lessons Learned

Building this library taught me about:

### API Design
Creating intuitive APIs that are both simple for basic use cases and flexible for complex scenarios.

### State Management
Handling real-time state synchronization across multiple components and user sessions.

### Library Distribution
Packaging, versioning, and distributing a TypeScript library with proper type definitions.

### User Experience
Balancing functionality with simplicity - making complex ownership logic feel natural.
