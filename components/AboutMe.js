        I am a <strong> web developer</strong> creating interactive
        applications, company websites, and company tools. {"I've "}focused
        primarily on front-ent applications, but am comfortable working with
        back-end technologies having created serveral backend applications using
        the ExpressjS framework connecting to both SQL and NOSQL databases.
      </p>
      <p>
        I find fulfillment in taking on topics that expand my skills and
        knowledge. Beyond web development, you can see the product of some of my
